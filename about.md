I'm a data scientist and machine learning engineer living in 
Stellenbosch and currently work on education,
health, and banking problems.

### Interests

My favourite tools are Python, `sklearn`, probabilistic graphical models, 
conditional random fields, probabilistic logic, and deep learning.

I'm also interested in natural language processing and how 
artificial intelligence is changing the world.
