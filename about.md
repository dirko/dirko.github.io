I'm a data scientist and machine learning engineer living in 
Stellenbosch and currently work with the team at [Praelexis](https://praelexis.com/) on education,
health, and banking problems. 

### Interests

My favourite tools are Python, `sklearn`, probabilistic graphical models, 
probabilistic logic, constraint programming, and, of course, deep learning.

I'm also interested in natural language processing and how 
artificial intelligence is changing the world.
