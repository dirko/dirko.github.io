I'm a data scientist and machine learning developer living in 
Stellenbosch and currently work on education,
health, and supply chain problems.

### More Information

My favourite tools are Python, `sklearn`, probabilistic graphical models, 
conditional random fields, and deep belief networks.

I'm also interested in natural language processing and how 
artificial intelligence is changing the world.
